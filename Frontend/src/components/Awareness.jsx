          Mangroves are not just treesâ€”they are **lifelines** for our coasts, communities, and climate.
          They protect us from natural disasters, provide livelihoods, store carbon, and sustain biodiversity.
          By reporting threats and participating in BioGroves, you make a **real-world impact** on the environment and society.
